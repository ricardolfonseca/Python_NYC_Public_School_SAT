# Project: Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores

### Overview

This project analyzes the performance of New York City public schools based on SAT scores. It explores a dataset containing SAT scores for various schools and aims to answer key questions related to school performance across different boroughs in New York City. The analysis was conducted using Python, with the focus on data manipulation and visualization using `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

While the project structure and problem were designed by DataCamp as a learning exercise, **all code and solutions have been written by me**.

### Questions Answered

The dataset was used to answer the following key questions:

1. **What are the top 10 schools with the highest average math scores?**
2. **What are the top 10 schools with the highest SAT scores?**
3. **What is the borough with the schools that have the largest standard deviation for SAT scores, and what are the average SAT scores in that borough?**

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` for data visualization

You can install them via `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

#### Running the Analysis

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Python_NYC_Public_School_SAT.git
```

2. Open the `notebook.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.

3. The analysis will run sequentially to answer the key questions about the schools' SAT scores. The results will be printed directly within the notebook, along with the corresponding visualizations.

### Data Source

The dataset `schools.csv` contains SAT scores for schools in New York City, including columns for:
- School name
- Borough
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Average writing score
